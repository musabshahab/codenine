# Claude

Codenine uses Claude Code's login and configuration. Start with the default provider
for one account; [provider setup](./install.md#providers) covers installation and
shared provider settings.

## Separate accounts or configurations

Use a separate Claude config directory for each account. This also works for named
presets that need different Claude settings or a router connection.

Keep your existing account in the default directory. On the environment's machine,
create the second login:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude_personal
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude_personal claude auth login
```

Add another Claude instance in **Settings > Providers**:

| Instance        | Binary path | CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR path |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Claude Work     | `claude`    | Leave empty            |
| Claude Personal | `claude`    | `~/.claude_personal`   |

An empty config-directory setting uses Claude Code's normal configuration. The
custom setting changes `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, leaving `HOME` and the system keychain
location intact. Use the same variable for the login command. Setting `HOME`
instead can put credentials where this provider will not find them.

Check the account reported in provider settings after signing in. Existing
threads can switch only between Claude instances with the same config directory.
Separate account directories stay isolated, including their local conversation
state. Claude does not have Codex's shared-home and shadow-home arrangement.

For presets that differ only in API keys or endpoints, use the instance's
**Environment variables**. Variable assignments do not belong in **Launch arguments**.

Claude Code's verbose mode can stay enabled when you use Claude for text generation, including
thread titles, branch names, commit messages, and pull request descriptions. On a remote connection,
Codenine uses the Claude configuration on the connected server.

## Compact long conversations

Set **Auto-compact after** in the Claude provider settings to an integer between
`100000` and `1000000`. For example, `300000` asks Claude to summarize at about
300,000 tokens. This changes when compaction happens, not the model's context
window. Leave it empty for Claude Code's default.

You can also send `/compact` in an existing conversation. Claude Code also
compacts automatically. To see context usage, see
[commands and skills](./composer.md#commands-and-skills).

When you return to a large thread after Claude's prompt cache expires, a
**Compact** chip with the thread's token count shows
next to the send button. While it is on, Enter summarizes the history first, then
sends your message. Click the chip to switch it to **Keep** and keep the full
history for that message. The cache lasts about an hour on a Claude
subscription and 5 minutes with an API key, Bedrock, or Vertex. See [commands and skills](./composer.md#commands-and-skills) for using
composer commands.

**Compact idle threads** in **Settings > Providers > Advanced** controls this for threads
over 200,000 tokens. Each Claude provider's settings can override it:

- **When you return** shows the **Compact** chip described above. This is the default.
- **Before the cache expires (beta)** tries to compact an idle thread shortly before its
  prompt cache expires, while the history is still cached.
  The compaction appears in the thread as a `/compact` turn sent by Codenine.
  If the window is missed, such as when you enable this mode after the cache has
  expired or the server restarts before compaction runs, it falls back to
  **When you return**. Switch the chip to **Keep** to keep the full history for that message.
- **Never** skips idle compaction and Claude's resume prompt. **Auto-compact after**
  still applies, and you can still compact by hand.

## Usage limits

If your Claude subscription runs out of usage mid-turn, the thread shows which
limit was reached and the remaining wait when Claude provides a reset time.
Claude Code holds the turn until that window reopens, so it can keep showing as
working. Wait for the reset, or stop the turn and continue later. The warning's
timestamp shows when the displayed wait started.

## Skills

Claude skills come from the config directory's `skills` folder and the project's
`.claude/skills` folder. If both define the same name, the config-directory copy
wins. Skills disabled in Claude's settings do not appear in the composer.

Use `$` in the composer to select a skill. Enabled installed Claude plugins also
contribute skills under names such as `plugin:review`. Skills marked `disable-model-invocation`
can still be started by you. Invoke those one per message: Claude directly runs
only the last named skill and may try to start earlier ones through its Skill
tool, which refuses skills reserved for manual invocation.

## Task lists

To show Claude task lists, add
`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1` under **Variables** in the Claude instance's
**Environment** section in **Settings > Providers**. Each update shows as a Tasks
row in the thread; open it to see every step.

## Use OpenRouter

With an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key, agents and team agents can run on models
from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, and others without a Claude or Codex sign-in. OpenRouter
runs through Claude Code, so Claude Code must be installed on the environment's machine, but you
do not sign in to it.

1. Create a key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
2. In **Settings > Providers**, select **Add provider**, choose **OpenRouter**, and select
   **Next**. On the Welcome page, select **Have an OpenRouter API key?** instead.
3. Paste the key, keep the starter models you want, and select **Add OpenRouter**.

Codenine stores the key as a secret and checks it with OpenRouter. If OpenRouter rejects it, open
the OpenRouter instance in **Settings > Providers** and replace **OpenRouter API key**. When the key
has a spending limit, the instance's status shows how much is left.

The instance lists only the models you add. To add one, copy its ID, such as
`anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5`, from [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models) and use
**Add custom model** in the instance's **Models** section. These models have fewer effort,
thinking, and context controls than Claude's own.

OpenRouter has no subscription limits; **Usage > Limits** links to OpenRouter's activity page
instead. While an OpenRouter instance is enabled, **Usage** prices OpenRouter models at
OpenRouter's published prices. That cost is an estimate from token counts; the activity page shows
what OpenRouter billed. To use your own price for a model, set it under
[Model prices](./usage.md#set-custom-model-prices).

## Other routers

A local router uses an ordinary Claude provider instance. Give it a separate
config directory and put the router's endpoint and credential variables in that
instance's **Environment variables**. The router must run where the environment
can reach it. Follow the [Claude Code Router instructions](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router)
for its installation and routing configuration.
